# Defensive-Cyber-Security-Projects
<b>Brandon Noeyâ€™s Defensive Cyber Security Projects</b><br><br><br>
	
This repository serves as a hub for my personal projects in defensive cybersecurity. It explores various techniques for: Traffic analysis, Malware analysis, ransomware, MitM attacks. <br><br><br>	
3.<b>Project List:</b><br><br>
<b>Incident Response: Phishing Email & Malware Infection (Endpoint Security):</b><br> This project details the analysis of a security incident involving a phishing email that infected a user's computer with multiple malware strains. It covers identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like malicious URLs, file hashes, and network traffic analysis. The project highlights the importance of endpoint security measures, user education on phishing attacks, and email security solutions to prevent similar incidents.<br><br>
<b>Incident Response: Multi-Stage Malware Attack (Network Security & Endpoint Security):</b> <br>This project analyzes network traffic logs to identify a multi-stage malware attack targeting a user's laptop. It details various Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like malicious file downloads, suspicious network communication, and file types associated with known malware families (Tordal, Win32/Ficker Stealer, Cobalt Strike Beacon). The project emphasizes the importance of network security measures, user education on safe browsing practices, and endpoint protection solutions to prevent similar attacks.<br><br>
<b>Incident Response: Qakbot Malware Infection (Endpoint Security):</b><br> This project investigates a security incident involving Qakbot malware infecting a user's computer within a coffee shop network. The analysis details Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) like suspicious file downloads (disguised as images), file hashes, network communication patterns, and known malware signatures. The project highlights the importance of endpoint security solutions, user education on phishing scams, and keeping software up-to-date to prevent such attacks.<br><br>
<b>Incident Response: Encrypted Files After Downloading Movies (Endpoint Security): </b><br>This project analyzes captured network traffic (using Wireshark) to investigate a malware infection on a personal computer. It demonstrates identifying malicious traffic patterns, extracting suspicious files, and leveraging VirusTotal for analysis. The project emphasizes the dangers of downloading files from untrusted websites and encourages caution when browsing the internet<br><br>
<b>Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark (Network Security & Incident Response): </b><br>This project introduces Wireshark and its application in analyzing a PCAP file containing simulated malicious traffic. It covers filtering techniques to identify suspicious patterns like C2 communication and file downloads. The project highlights the importance of network traffic analysis for threat hunting, incident response, and understanding the impact of malware infections.<br><br><br>

4. <b>Technologies Used:</b><br><br>
<b>Wireshark (Network Traffic Analysis): </b><br>Used in several projects to analyze captured network traffic (PCAP files) for identifying malicious activity, filtering suspicious patterns, and understanding malware communication (Incident Response: Encrypted Files After Downloading Movies & Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark).<br>
<b>VirusTotal (Malware Analysis):</b><br> Used to analyze suspicious files extracted from network traffic to identify potential malware strains and their behavior (Incident Response: Encrypted Files After Downloading Movies).<br>
<b>General Incident Response Techniques:</b><br> These projects showcase core practices of incident response, including isolating infected systems, analyzing evidence, and implementing remediation strategies (all Incident Response projects).<br><br><br>
